# Digital Note


Digital Note is a project which involves the use of different types of instruments online. This project will feature musical instruments such as the piano, drums, trumpets, and harmonica. Talking about this project, this system is very much user-friendly due to its simple and compact design. The users will be able to learn and play instruments as much as they like. Our goal is to help those people who want to play instruments but do not have the equipment so that they can truly express their love for music.

It's your turn. Play great music through some virtual instruments online using Digital Note. You don't need to download or install anything, and you can play free of charge. Just select your instrument to play, and you’re good to go. Tap and play your heart away!


## Features


* Multiple instruments to play with

In this project, you will be able to play these 3 types of instruments in just one click. On the site’s homepage, you will see 4 types of instruments and their respective buttons. Once you’ve clicked the button, it will take you to the main page for that instrument. Once you’re on the main page of the instruments, you can see different icons and tap them for you to play. You can choose different types of sounds on each button. You can also change some tones, pitch, or octaves on the instrument of your choice.



* Open for experimental features

The website is designed to be easy to add experimental features such as new instruments. With experimental features and new instruments, the project can withstand for a long time without getting stale due to it being easy to expand upon.



* Keystroke container

When an instrument is open, there is a white container on top where it stores keystrokes. The reason for this feature is that it allows you to store these keystrokes somewhere and later on be played again by just following the keystrokes written.


## Navigating throughout the web pages


### Main Menu

Navigating around the website is extremely straightforward. Once the site is opened, you are greeted with a modern design. You are presented with the title of the website, its description, and stating its purpose. Scroll down, and you’ll see the list of instruments that are available to be played instantly with a click.
